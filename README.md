This project was built in React and I used GitHub to manage the project from the start using a development branch to work in and merging with master branch when I reach goal points in the ptoject timeline. 

I created a wireframe with pen and paper to give me a visial representation of what I was aiming to build. 

To date the project is yet to be finished. Project process so far: 

1) Functionality that allows user to input player names which get stored in an array. 
2) If user clicks the generate pairings button but havent entered an even number of players, alert will pop up telling the user that they have x number of players currently and they need to enter more to have an even number of players. 
3) I've wrote the code to randomise the array of player names and output in pairs. When running this code in node in the terminal I get the initial array back with it randomised and put into pairs. Have struggled to get this to work within my React app. If devtools are open and randomised button is pressed players names come back paired but have struggled to get this take next steps to get this to render to the screen. 
4) Basic styling inline with my inital wireframe design. 

Things still to get done: 

1) Get generate pairins button working, so player names render on the screen e.g 'playername vs playername'.
2) Ability to record scores for each player and mark which player has won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
3) Continued rounds created until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other, one marked as the winner)
4) Clean up styling - make page responive to make it viewable on smaller screens and devices.
